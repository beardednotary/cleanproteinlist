            <div class="mission-box">
                <h3>Why Clean Protein List Exists</h3>
                <p>In October 2025, Consumer Reports published shocking findings: <strong>only 30% of tested protein powders were safe for daily consumption.</strong> Some contained lead levels up to <strong>15 times over California's safe limits.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Millions of people drink protein shakes daily, believing they're making a healthy choice. Instead, many are unknowingly consuming dangerous levels of heavy metals that accumulate in the body over time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Clean Protein List exists to solve this problem.</strong> We aggregate independent testing data from Consumer Reports, Clean Label Project, and NSF International to help consumers quickly identify which protein powders are actually safe.</p>

            <p>Clean Protein List was founded by <strong>Ray Rothwell</strong>, a US military veteran who separated from service 20 years ago. After years in the fitness community and seeing friends unknowingly consume contaminated supplements, Ray decided to create a centralized resource that makes safety data accessible to everyone.</p>

                "After discovering that some of the most popular protein powders contained dangerous levels of lead, I realized most people had no idea this was even an issue. Clean Protein List was born from a simple question: Why isn't there an easy way to know which protein powders are actually safe?"

            <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
            
            <div class="process-steps">
                <h3>How We Create Our Database</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Source Independent Testing Data</h4>
                <p>We aggregate heavy metal testing results from trusted third-party organizations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Reports</strong> - October 2025 testing of 23 protein powders for lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean Label Project</strong> - "Clean Sixteen" certification for protein powders with non-detectable heavy metals</li>
                    <li><strong>NSF Certified for Sport</strong> - Batch testing for contaminants and banned substances</li>
                    <li><strong>Informed Choice/Sport</strong> - Third-party testing for quality and purity</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2. Analyze & Rank by Safety</h4>
                <p>We organize products into clear safety categories based on test results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Safe for Daily Use</strong> - Lead levels below or near California Prop 65 limits (0.5 µg/day)</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit Use</strong> - Moderate contamination requiring frequency restriction</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid</strong> - Dangerous contamination levels (10x+ over safe limits)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3. Provide Context & Alternatives</h4>
                <p>For every product, we explain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What the contamination levels mean for your health</li>
                    <li>Safe consumption frequency based on daily exposure limits</li>
                    <li>Verified-clean alternatives if your brand tested poorly</li>
                    <li>Price comparisons so safety doesn't break your budget</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>4. Keep Data Current</h4>
                <p>We update our database when new testing results are published by Consumer Reports, Clean Label Project, or other independent testing organizations.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Q: Do you test protein powders yourself?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> No, we aggregate testing results from independent third-party organizations like Consumer Reports, Clean Label Project, and NSF International. These organizations have certified laboratories and rigorous testing protocols.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: Why should I trust your recommendations?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> We don't create the test results - we report them. Every ranking is based on publicly available data from trusted testing organizations. We link to original sources so you can verify independently.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: Do brands pay to be featured?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> No. Rankings are based solely on heavy metal testing results. We maintain complete independence from supplement brands.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: How do you make money if brands don't pay you?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> We earn small commissions when you purchase products through our Amazon affiliate links. This doesn't affect product prices or influence our rankings.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: My favorite brand wasn't tested. Can you test it?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> We don't conduct testing ourselves. We can add your brand to our "untested" list and recommend you contact the manufacturer directly to request third-party testing results.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: How often do you update the database?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> We update immediately when new testing results are published by Consumer Reports, Clean Label Project, or other testing organizations. Major testing typically occurs annually.</p>
