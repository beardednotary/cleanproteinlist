                        <h3>Can you buy protein powder with EBT?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes, you can buy protein powder with EBT/SNAP benefits in most states.</strong> Protein powder qualifies as a food item if it's marketed as a dietary supplement food (has Nutrition Facts label) rather than a performance supplement. Purchase at SNAP-authorized retailers like Walmart, Amazon (after EBT registration), Target, or grocery stores. Look for "EBT eligible" labels when shopping.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Where can I buy protein powder with EBT?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Major retailers accepting EBT for protein powder:</strong> Walmart (in-store and online), Amazon (after registering EBT card at amazon.com/snap), Target (select locations), grocery stores (Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons), and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club). GNC and Vitamin Shoppe typically do NOT accept EBT. Always look for "EBT eligible" or "SNAP eligible" labels.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the cheapest safe protein powder for EBT users?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey costs $0.67 per serving</strong> and is the cheapest verified-safe protein powder. It's Clean Label certified with non-detectable lead, available at Walmart with in-store EBT (no registration needed), and on Amazon after EBT registration. For $0.75/serving, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard ranked #5 safe and is widely available.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I use EBT on Amazon?</h3>
                        <p><strong>To use EBT on Amazon:</strong></p>

                            <li>Sign in to your Amazon account</li>
                            <li>Click "Add EBT Card" and enter card number</li>
                            <li>Verify with your EBT PIN</li>
                            <li>Shop for items marked "EBT eligible"</li>

                        <h3>Does all protein powder qualify for EBT?</h3>
                        <p><strong>No, not all protein powder qualifies.</strong> SNAP allows protein powder marketed as food/dietary supplements (Nutrition Facts label) but excludes products marketed for bodybuilding or athletic performance (Supplement Facts label). Pre-workout supplements, amino acids, and specialty sports nutrition typically don't qualify. Basic whey protein, plant protein, and meal replacement shakes usually qualify. Check for "EBT eligible" labels.</p>

                        <p><strong>Yes, after registering your EBT card at amazon.com/snap.</strong> Amazon offers discounted Prime membership for EBT cardholders at $6.99 per month (regular $14.99). Prime EBT members get free delivery on Amazon Fresh orders over $35 plus standard Prime benefits. Many protein powders are EBT-eligible - look for the "EBT eligible" badge on product pages.</p>
