                <h3>🚨 Breaking Lawsuit News</h3>
                <p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;">
                    On <strong>February 9, 2026</strong>, a California class action lawsuit was filed against Jocko Fuel, LLC alleging their Chocolate Milkshake protein powder contains <strong>1.326 µg of lead per serving</strong>—2.65 times California's Proposition 65 safe limit of 0.5 µg/day for reproductive toxicity.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Quick Summary: What You Need to Know</h2>
            
            <div class="lawsuit-facts">
                <h4>Key Lawsuit Facts:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Jocko Protein Powder Mölk Protein Blend (Chocolate Milkshake flavor)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead Level:</strong> 1.326 µg per 34-gram serving</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe Limit:</strong> 0.5 µg/day (California Prop 65)</li>
                    <li><strong>Percentage Over Limit:</strong> 265% (2.65x the safe limit)</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Date:</strong> January 2025 (independent lab commissioned by plaintiff's counsel)</li>
                    <li><strong>Price:</strong> ~$48 per unit on Amazon</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing Claims:</strong> "CLEAN FUEL," naturally sweetened, minimal ingredients</li>
                    <li><strong>Filed:</strong> February 9, 2026 in California federal court</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>The irony?</strong> Jocko Fuel markets this product as "CLEAN FUEL" with bold health claims—yet independent testing revealed lead contamination at levels that trigger mandatory Proposition 65 warnings for reproductive harm.</p>

            <h2>The Lawsuit Details: What Jocko Is Accused Of</h2>

            <p>The 22-page class action complaint, filed in California federal court (Case No. 3:26cv791), alleges that Jocko Fuel:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Failed to Disclose Lead Contamination:</strong> Despite California Prop 65 requirements, Jocko allegedly did not warn consumers about lead levels exceeding safe limits</li>
                <li><strong>Deceptive Marketing:</strong> Promoted the product as "CLEAN FUEL" while containing 2.65x the safe lead limit</li>
                <li><strong>Violated California Consumer Protection Laws:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>California Unfair Competition Law</li>
                        <li>California Consumers Legal Remedies Act</li>
                        <li>California False Advertising Law</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Obscured Health Risks:</strong> Highlighted "naturally sweetened" and "few ingredients" to distract from heavy metal contamination</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"Defendant's failure to disclose the lead in the Products, in light of the label Representations, deprives consumers of making an informed choice between protein products available in the marketplace."</p>
                <p><strong>— From the Class Action Complaint</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>How the Lead Level Was Determined</h2>

            <p>The lead contamination figure (1.326 µg per serving) comes from <strong>independent testing commissioned in January 2025</strong> by the plaintiff's legal counsel. Key testing details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Laboratory:</strong> Accredited lab (unnamed in complaint)</li>
                <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> FDA-approved testing protocols</li>
                <li><strong>Sample:</strong> Jocko Protein Powder Mölk Protein Blend, Chocolate Milkshake flavor</li>
                <li><strong>Serving Size:</strong> 34 grams (standard scoop)</li>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> 1.326 µg lead per serving</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>California's Safe Limit:</strong> Proposition 65 sets the Maximum Allowable Dose Level (MADL) for lead at 0.5 µg/day for reproductive toxicity. Jocko's product allegedly contains <strong>2.65 times this limit in a single serving</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Why Lead Contamination Matters</h2>

            <p>The lawsuit cites multiple health agencies, including the <strong>World Health Organization</strong>, which states:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"There is no level of exposure to lead that is known to be without harmful effects."</p>
                <p><strong>— World Health Organization</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Health risks from chronic lead exposure include:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neurological Damage:</strong> Impaired cognitive function, memory problems, difficulty concentrating</li>
                <li><strong>Reproductive Harm:</strong> The specific toxicity threshold California's Prop 65 protects against</li>
                <li><strong>Organ Damage:</strong> Kidneys, liver, cardiovascular system</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Disorders:</strong> Anemia, reduced hemoglobin</li>
                <li><strong>Severe Cases:</strong> Seizures, coma, death</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>For daily protein users:</strong> If someone consumes one serving of Jocko Chocolate Milkshake protein powder daily, they're getting 1.326 µg of lead per day—nearly <strong>3x California's safe daily limit</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> While Jocko's contamination is lower than the worst offenders (Naked, Garden of Life, Premier), it's still <strong>2.65 times over California's safe limit</strong>—high enough to trigger mandatory warnings and now a lawsuit.</p>

            <h2>The "CLEAN FUEL" Marketing Problem</h2>

            <p>The lawsuit specifically targets Jocko's aggressive "clean" marketing:</p>

            <div class="lawsuit-facts">
                <h4>Jocko's Label Claims:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ "CLEAN FUEL" (prominent on label)</li>
                    <li>✅ "Naturally sweetened"</li>
                    <li>✅ "Minimal ingredients"</li>
                    <li>✅ Grass-fed whey protein</li>
                    <li>❌ <strong>NO mention of lead contamination</strong></li>
                    <li>❌ <strong>NO Prop 65 warning</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The complaint argues that Jocko "has an improper motive—to derive financial gain at the expense of accuracy or truthfulness" by emphasizing clean ingredients while hiding heavy metal test results.</p>

            <p><strong>The plaintiff's story:</strong> A California resident purchased Jocko Chocolate Milkshake protein powder "on numerous occasions" from Amazon for ~$48 per unit. He claims he would not have bought it—or would have paid less—if he knew about the lead levels.</p>

            <h2>How This Connects to California SB 1033</h2>

            <p>This lawsuit arrives at a pivotal moment: just <strong>2 days after California State Senator Steve Padilla introduced SB 1033</strong>, legislation requiring protein manufacturers to test every batch for heavy metals and publicly disclose results.</p>

            <p><strong>If SB 1033 passes, Jocko would be required to:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Test every batch of protein powder for lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury</li>
                <li>Publish test results publicly, organized by lot/batch number</li>
                <li>Include a direct link or QR code on packaging to access results</li>
                <li>Face a sales ban in California if not compliant</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Pattern of Protein Powder Lawsuits</h2>

            <p>Jocko joins a growing list of protein brands facing legal action for heavy metal contamination:</p>

            <p><strong>The trend is clear:</strong> California's aggressive enforcement of Prop 65 combined with Consumer Reports testing has exposed widespread contamination—and plaintiff's attorneys are taking action.</p>

            <h2>What Should Jocko Users Do?</h2>

            <h3>If You Currently Use Jocko Chocolate Milkshake Protein:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stop Daily Use:</strong> At 2.65x over California's safe limit, daily consumption poses cumulative lead exposure risk</li>
                <li><strong>Check Other Flavors:</strong> This lawsuit specifically targets Chocolate Milkshake—other Jocko flavors may have different contamination levels (not yet tested publicly)</li>
                <li><strong>Switch to Verified-Safe Alternatives:</strong> See recommendations below</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor the Lawsuit:</strong> Class action status pending (covers California residents who purchased within 4 years of Feb 9, 2026)</li>

            <h2>Jocko's Response (If Any)</h2>

            <p><strong>As of February 13, 2026:</strong> Jocko Fuel has not publicly responded to the lawsuit. We will update this article if they issue a statement.</p>

            <p><strong>Possible defenses Jocko might raise:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Challenge the accuracy of plaintiff's independent testing</li>
                <li>Argue that lead levels vary by batch (only one batch tested)</li>
                <li>Claim Prop 65 warnings aren't required for protein powders (unlikely to succeed)</li>
                <li>Settle out of court (as Garden of Life did for $1.8M)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Is all Jocko protein contaminated with lead?</h3>
            <p>The lawsuit specifically targets the <strong>Chocolate Milkshake</strong> flavor. Other Jocko flavors have not been publicly tested by independent labs. Until Jocko publishes batch-level testing results (as SB 1033 would require), consumers don't know contamination levels in other flavors.</p>

            <h3>Can I join the class action lawsuit?</h3>
            <p>The proposed class includes California residents who purchased Jocko Protein Powder Mölk Protein Blend (Chocolate Milkshake flavor) within 4 years of February 9, 2026, and do not claim personal injury. If certified, affected buyers will be notified. Check <a href="https://www.classaction.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ClassAction.org</a> for updates.</p>

            <h3>How does Jocko's lead level compare to Consumer Reports testing?</h3>
            <p>Consumer Reports tested 28 protein powders in October 2025. We don't have Jocko's specific Consumer Reports ranking, but at 1.326 µg lead, it would fall in the middle of the contamination range—worse than the safest options (MuscleTech at 0.0 µg) but better than the worst (Naked at 5.89 µg).</p>

            <h3>Is 1.326 µg of lead per serving dangerous?</h3>
            <p>California Prop 65 sets 0.5 µg/day as the safe limit for reproductive toxicity. At 1.326 µg per serving, Jocko exceeds this by 2.65x. While a single serving won't cause acute harm, <strong>chronic daily exposure</strong> over months/years can lead to neurological damage, organ issues, and reproductive harm.</p>

            <h3>Why does Jocko have lead if it's "grass-fed" and "clean"?</h3>
            <p>Lead contamination in protein powders typically comes from:
                <ul>
                    <li>Soil contamination (plants absorb lead from soil—especially cocoa for chocolate flavors)</li>
                    <li>Processing equipment</li>
                    <li>Ingredient sourcing (cocoa, cacao, plant proteins accumulate heavy metals)</li>
                </ul>
            "Grass-fed" and "naturally sweetened" don't protect against heavy metal contamination. Only independent lab testing does.</p>

            <h3>Should I throw away my Jocko protein?</h3>
            <p>If you have Chocolate Milkshake flavor and use it daily, consider switching to a verified-safe alternative. Occasional use (2-3x/week) poses lower risk than daily consumption.</p>

            <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>January 2025:</strong> Independent lab testing commissioned by plaintiff's counsel tests Jocko Chocolate Milkshake protein</li>
                <li><strong>February 9, 2026:</strong> Class action lawsuit filed in California federal court</li>
                <li><strong>February 11, 2026:</strong> California Senator Padilla introduces SB 1033 (mandatory testing/disclosure bill)</li>
                <li><strong>February 13, 2026:</strong> Lawsuit details reported by ClassAction.org</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters</h2>

            <p>The Jocko lawsuit is part of a larger shift in protein powder accountability:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Consumer Reports Testing (Oct 2025):</strong> Exposed that 74% of tested proteins exceed safe lead limits</li>
                <li><strong>California SB 1033 (Feb 2026):</strong> Proposed mandatory testing and public disclosure</li>
                <li><strong>Growing Lawsuits:</strong> Garden of Life ($1.8M), Ritual (AG notice), now Jocko</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Awareness:</strong> People are demanding transparency and verification</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>The industry can no longer hide behind "clean" marketing.</strong> Independent testing and legal action are forcing transparency.</p>
