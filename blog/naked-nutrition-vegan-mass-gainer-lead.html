                        <p><strong>California Prop 65 sets the safe harbor limit at 0.5 µg lead per day</strong> - the level at which there's "no significant risk" of harm.</p>

                <!-- Why So High -->
                <section id="why-so-high">
                    <h2>Why Does Naked Nutrition Have So Much Lead?</h2>

                    <p><strong>Three factors combine to create this extreme contamination:</strong></p>

                    <div class="contamination-factors-grid">
                        <div class="contamination-factor">
                            <h4>1. Plant-Based Protein (Primary Source)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Naked Nutrition uses pea + rice protein blend.</strong></p>
                            <p>Plant proteins absorb lead from soil through their roots. Plants cannot distinguish between beneficial minerals and toxic metals, so they absorb both.</p>
                            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Plant proteins have 10-15x more lead than whey proteins. Consumer Reports found 77% of plant proteins exceeded safe limits vs only 28% of whey proteins.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="contamination-factor">
                            <h4>2. Massive Serving Size (Amplifies Problem)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Naked Nutrition Vegan Mass Gainer uses 170g serving size</strong> (compared to typical 30-35g protein servings).</p>
                            <p>Larger serving = more total protein powder = more accumulated contamination from that powder.</p>
                            <p><strong>Even if the contamination per gram were "moderate," the huge serving size concentrates it into dangerous territory.</strong></p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="contamination-factor">
                            <h4>3. Chocolate Flavor (Adds Cadmium)</h4>
                            <p><strong>The tested product was chocolate flavor.</strong></p>
                            <p>Chocolate flavoring comes from cocoa beans that naturally accumulate cadmium from tropical volcanic soils. While Consumer Reports primarily reported lead levels, chocolate proteins typically have 110x more cadmium than vanilla.</p>
                            <p><strong>Naked Nutrition combines plant protein lead + chocolate cadmium = double contamination.</strong></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The "Naked" Marketing Problem</h3>

                    <p><strong>Naked Nutrition markets itself as "Nothing but the Good Stuff" - implying purity and cleanliness.</strong></p>

                    <p>Their branding emphasizes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"No artificial sweeteners, flavors, or colors"</li>
                        <li>"Only natural ingredients"</li>
                        <li>"Clean, simple nutrition"</li>
                        <li>Premium pricing ($2.50/serving)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>But "natural" and "clean" marketing means NOTHING for heavy metal safety.</strong></p>

                    <p>Heavy metals ARE natural - they occur naturally in soil. Natural ≠ Safe. The contamination is FROM natural sources (soil, plants).</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box yellow">
                        <h4>💡 The Natural Contamination Irony</h4>
                        <p><strong>Naked Nutrition's contamination problem is BECAUSE they use "natural" plant ingredients.</strong></p>
                        <p>Peas and rice grown in soil absorb lead naturally. No artificial additives needed - the contamination comes from the "clean, simple" ingredients they market.</p>
                        <p><strong>This is why independent testing matters.</strong> Marketing claims about "purity" are meaningless without third-party heavy metal verification.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>All Naked plant-based products (pea, rice, vegan blends):</strong> Assume HIGH RISK. Same contamination sources as the tested product.</li>
                        <li><strong>Naked Whey/Casein:</strong> Likely lower contamination (whey is naturally cleaner), but WITHOUT testing verification, safety cannot be confirmed.</li>

                        <h4>⚠️ "Premium" Doesn't Mean "Safe"</h4>
                        <p><strong>Naked Nutrition products cost $2.00-2.50 per serving - premium pricing that suggests quality.</strong></p>
                        <p>But their vegan mass gainer ranked WORST in testing despite premium price.</p>
<p><strong>Price does NOT predict heavy metal safety.</strong> Body Fortress ($0.67/serving) tested Clean Label certified. Naked Nutrition ($2.50/serving) had 7.86 µg lead.</p>
<p><strong>Only independent testing matters.</strong> Without Clean Label or Consumer Reports verification, you're gambling with your health regardless of price.</p>

                        <h4>Step 2: See Your Doctor</h4>
                        <p><strong>Request blood lead level testing.</strong> Tell your doctor specifically:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Calcium-rich diet (dairy, leafy greens) - competes with lead absorption</li>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-grid">

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Does Naked Nutrition contain lead?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes. Naked Nutrition Vegan Mass Gainer contains 7.86 µg of lead per serving</strong> - the highest level found in Consumer Reports' October 2025 testing of 23 protein powders. This is 1,572% over California's Prop 65 safe harbor limit. It ranked #23 (worst) in safety.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is Naked Nutrition safe to use?</h3>
                        <p><strong>No. Naked Nutrition Vegan Mass Gainer is NOT safe for daily use.</strong> At 15.7x the safe limit, it poses serious health risks including brain damage, kidney disease, and cardiovascular problems. Consumer Reports rated it as having the worst heavy metal contamination of all tested proteins.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why does Naked Nutrition have so much lead?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Three factors combine:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Plant-based protein</strong> (pea + rice) absorbs lead from soil - 10-15x more than whey</li>
                            <li><strong>Large serving size</strong> (170g) concentrates contamination</li>
                            <li><strong>Chocolate flavor</strong> adds cadmium from cocoa beans</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Plant proteins cannot filter metals absorbed through roots, leading to high contamination levels.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What should I use instead of Naked Nutrition?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Safe alternatives verified by independent testing:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Plant-based:</strong> OWYN Pro Elite (#7, only safe plant protein)</li>
                            <li><strong>Mass gainer:</strong> MuscleTech 100% Mass Gainer (#1, lead not detected)</li>
                            <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Body Fortress ($0.67/serving, Clean Label certified)</li>
                            <li><strong>Premium:</strong> Dymatize ISO 100 (#2, dual verified)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I stop using Naked Nutrition immediately?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes. Stop today.</strong> At 7.86 µg lead per serving (15.7x safe limit), daily consumption poses serious health risks. Do not finish the container. Order a verified-safe alternative immediately. If you've used it daily for 6+ months, consider blood lead testing with your doctor.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much lead is in Naked Nutrition compared to safe brands?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Naked Nutrition (7.86 µg) vs safe brands:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>MuscleTech:</strong> NOT DETECTED (0 µg) = infinitely safer</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimum Nutrition:</strong> Below detection (~0.1 µg) = 80x less lead</li>
                            <li><strong>OWYN Pro Elite:</strong> Below detection = infinitely safer (only safe plant option)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Naked Nutrition has approximately <strong>80-100x more lead than safe brands.</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is Naked Whey protein also contaminated?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Unknown - Naked Whey was NOT tested by Consumer Reports.</strong> Only the Vegan Mass Gainer was tested. Whey protein generally has 10-15x less lead than plant protein, so Naked Whey likely has lower contamination. However, without independent testing verification, safety cannot be confirmed. Use verified-safe whey brands instead (MuscleTech, Optimum Nutrition, Dymatize).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I get lead poisoning from Naked Nutrition?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes. Daily consumption will cause lead accumulation and poisoning.</strong> At 7.86 µg per serving (15.7x safe limit), chronic health effects are highly likely with regular use. Symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, memory problems, kidney damage, high blood pressure. Lead has no safe exposure level - any amount causes harm, and this amount is extreme.</p>
