                <h3>📊 How We Choose Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Our recommendations are based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Reports October 2025 testing</strong> for heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury)</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-party certifications:</strong> NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Choice, USP Verified</li>
                    <li><strong>Manufacturer transparency</strong> about testing practices and ingredient sourcing</li>
                    <li><strong>Independent lab results</strong> when available from Clean Label Project and other testing organizations</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Safety scores are relative</strong> - even "5-star" products may contain trace amounts of heavy metals (which occur naturally in many foods). We prioritize products with the lowest detectable levels and strongest testing protocols.</p>
